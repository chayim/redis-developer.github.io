Redis is an open source, in-memory, key-value data store most commonly used as a primary database, cache, message broker, and message queue. Redis cache delivers sub-millisecond response times, enabling fast and powerful real-time applications in industries such as gaming, fintech, ad-tech, social media, healthcare, and IoT. The Stream is a new data type introduced with Redis 5.0, which models a log data structure in a more abstract way.
A Redis Stream is a Redis data type that represents a log, so you can add new information and message in an append-only mode. 
Redis Streams lets you build “Kafka-like” applications, which can:



*   Create applications that publish and consume messages. Nothing extraordinary here, you could already do that with Redis Pub/Sub(Publisher/Subscriber).
*   Consume messages that are published even when the client application (consumer) is not running. This is a big difference from Redis Pub/Sub.
*   Consume messages starting from a specific point. For example, read the whole history or only new messages. 

In addition, Redis Streams has the concept of a consumer group. Redis Streams consumer groups, like the similar concept in [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), allows client applications to consume messages in a distributed fashion (multiple clients), making it easy to scale and create highly available systems.

Let’s dive under the covers and see [Redis Streams](https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro) through the lens of RedisInsight. You will see how to use the [Lettuce Java client](https://developer.redis.com/develop/java/#using-lettuce) to publish and consume messages using consumer group.This is the first basic example that uses a single consumer.

## Prerequisite:



-   [Install OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/install/)
-   [Install Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
-   [Install Redis](https://developer.redis.com/create)

### Step 1. Run a Redis server

Redis is an open source, in-memory, key-value data store most commonly used as a primary database, cache, message broker, and queue. Redis delivers sub-millisecond response times, enabling fast and powerful real-time applications in industries such as gaming, fintech, ad-tech, social media, healthcare, and IoT. You can run a Redis database directly over your local mac os or in a container. If you have Docker installed in your sytem, type the following command:

```bash
 docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redislabs/redismod
```

You can connect to Redis server using the `redis-cli` command like this:

```
 redis-cli
```

The above command will make a connection to the Redis server. It will then present a prompt that allows you to run Redis commands.
Please note that you can connect to Redis server using multiple clients.

## Step 2: Download RedisInsight


To install RedisInsight on your local system, you need to first download the software from the Redis website.

[Click this link ](https://redis.com/redis-enterprise/redis-insight/#insight-form) to access a form that allows you to select the operating system of your choice.

Run the installer. After the web server starts, open http://YOUR_HOST_IP:8001 and add a Redis database connection.

Select "Connect to a Redis database"
![My Image](images/redisinsight4.png)

Enter the requested details, including Name, Host (endpoint), Port, and Password.  Then click “ADD REDIS DATABASE”.



## Step 3. Cloning the repository


 ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-streams-101-java
  cd redis-streams-101-java
  mvn clean verify
 ```


## Step 4. Run the producer(Post a new message)


 ```bash

  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.kanibl.redis.streams.simple.RedisStreams101Producer" -Dexec.args="5"

 ```


## Step 5. Run the consumer(Consume messages)

Open a new terminal and run this command:


 ```bash

  mvn exec:java -Dexec.main
 ```


The consumer will start and consume the message you just posted, and wait for any new messages.

## Step 6: Posting the new messages

In the first terminal, let us post new entries to a Redis stream:


 ```bash
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.kanibl.redis.streams.simple.RedisStreams101Producer" -Dexec.args="100"
 ```


Let us try to visualise the latest message using the RedisInsight browser tool. Make sure ‘Stream Data’ is selected and select any one of the streams. For a specified stream, you’ll find a table showing data in that stream along with a timestamp of when each entry was added.

To see the processing side of the stream select ‘Stream Data”. You will see 105 records under the streaming data.





![alt_text](images/image17.png)


Click on “Consumer Group” to see application_1 as promising active consumers.

RedisInsight also provide you to select fields as shown under “View Columns” section.

It also displays pending items/messages for the specific streams as shown above.
