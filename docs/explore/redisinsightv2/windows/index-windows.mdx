RedisInsight is a visual tool that provides capabilities to design, develop and optimize your Redis application. It is a 100% free Redis GUI that allows developers like you to interact with your databases and manage your data.


RedisInsight v2.0 incorporates a completely new tech stack based on the popular Electron and Elastic UI frameworks. You can run the application locally along with your favorite IDE, and it remains cross-platform, supported on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. RedisInsight Browser lets you explore keys in your Redis server. You can add, edit and delete a key. You can even update the key expiry and copy the key name to be used in different parts of the application.

## RedisInsight Windows Installer

The RedisInsight desktop client installer for Windows is just 70 MB in size. It allows you to download and use the RedisInsight GUI locally. The desktop client is supported on Windows operating systems and works with all variants of Redis. RedisInsight should install and run on a fresh Windows system.

### Step 5. Overview of User database keys

Let us import a user database (6k keys). This dataset contains users stored as Redis Hashes.


### 
**Users**

The user hashes contain the following fields:



*   `user:id` : The key of the hash.
*   `first_name` : First Name.
*   `last_name` : Last name.
*   `email` : email address.
*   `gender` : Gender (male/female).
*   `ip_address` : IP address.
*   `country` : Country Name.
*   `country_code` : Country Code.
*   `city` : City of the user.
*   `longitude` : Longitude of the user.
*   `latitude` : Latitude of the user.
*   `last_login` : Epoch time of the last login.

### Step 6. Clone the repository

Open up the CLI terminal and run the following commands:

 ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-datasets
  cd redis-datasets/user-database
 ```


### Step 7. Import the user database keys

Open up the CLI terminal and run the following command.

:::note NOTE
You will need a hostname, port and password to run this for a cloud database.
:::

 ```bash
  redis-cli -h redis-18386.c110-qa.us-east-1-1.ec2.cloud.redislabs.com -p 18386 -a <enter your password> < ./import_users.redis
 ```
