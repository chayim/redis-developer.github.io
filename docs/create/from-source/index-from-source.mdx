### Step 1: Download, extract and compile Redis

Redis stands for  REmote  DIctionary  Server. Redis is an open source, in-memory, key-value data store most commonly used as a primary database, cache, message broker, and queue. Redis cache delivers sub-millisecond response times, enabling fast and powerful real-time applications in industries such as gaming, fintech, ad-tech, social media, healthcare, and IoT.

In order to install Redis from source, first you need to download the latest Redis source code. 
The Redis source code is available to download [here](https://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz). You can verify the integrity of these downloads by checking them against the digests in the [redis-hashes git repository](https://github.com/redis/redis-hashes)

 
```
wget https://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
cd redis-stable
make
```

It is a good idea to copy both the Redis server and the command line interface into the proper places, either manually using the following commands:

```
sudo cp src/redis-server /usr/local/bin/
sudo cp src/redis-cli /usr/local/bin/
```
Or just using ```sudo make install.```

The binaries that are now compiled are available in the src directory. 


### Step 2: Running Redis Server

Install the Redis server by running the following command:
 
```
$ redis-server
```
Please note that you don't need to restart the Redis service.

### Step 3: Interacting with Redis Client

Once the Redis installation has completed, you can use the Redis client to connect to the Redis server.
Use the following commands to store and retrieve a string:
```
$ src/redis-cli
redis> set foo bar
OK
redis> get foo
"bar"
```

`redis.conf` is the Redis configuration file, used to configure the behavior of the Redis Server.  For more information on the available configuration options, check out the [documentation on redis.io](https://redis.io/docs/manual/config/).
